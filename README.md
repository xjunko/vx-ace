# vx-ace
My own version of the long lost DLDB's script injection thingamajig.

# Features
- Supports custom scripts (You can write your own code in the `Data_Cheat/scripts` folder.
- Minor improvements here and there.
- Remade the Internal script patcher.

# How to use
- Download from [here](https://codeload.github.com/xjunko/vx-ace/zip/refs/heads/master) and extract it in your game directory.
- Launch the `Game_Cheat.exe`, wait for it to patch, relaunch.
- Profit.

# Notes
- For those who are techy enough to know the basics of RPGM/RGSS, you can skip the whole `Game_Cheat.exe` stuff and replace the original one instead.
- Also you can edit the script loader from the editor, so have fun with that :D.
- You need to replace the `Scripts.rvdata2` file in the `Data_Cheat` with the original one (from the zip/rar) again to repatch.
